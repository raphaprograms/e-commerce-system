How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.
It was important to type annotate the Product class to be sure that the right type of data was being fetched from the API and also to ensure the fuctions were recieving the correct data types. Also when extending the error classes OOP was vital. 

The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.
In order to display the products with the desired data and not all the data I needed to map over the data from the API and return the products in the shape of the product class, another challenge was formatting the numbers to two decimal places. 

How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.
I handled this with custom error classes that extented from from the Error type. This alon with conditional statements to test if an error needed to be thrown and to decide which type to throw. 

Overall this was a great learning project and I felt well prepared after attending the lecture.
